                    <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States?</summary>
                    <p>The Taco was first introduced to the United States in <strong>1905</strong>. Mexican migrants were coming in to work on railroads and other jobs and started to bring their delicious food with them. Tacos were essentially a street food at this time since they were highly portable and cheap.</p>
